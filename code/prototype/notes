Router A seems to download faster then Router B, after the bandwidth throttling has been applied. Not sure of the cause. Also, the limit that we apply doesn't 
correlate with the effective bandwidth.

For instance, on router A, a 10 kbps limit yields an effective bandwidth of 5.06 mbps. Yet on router B, a limit of 66 kbps is required to produce the same effect.
