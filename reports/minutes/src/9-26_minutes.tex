Much success with python & 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Python has been wonderful. Lots of good python proxies out there, some better supported then others.
		\item Twisted proxy was the best of all of these, with the most documentation out there by far. 
		\item Twisted allows you to override any of its underlying classes with the functionality that you want. This makes the library super extendible.
		\item Cool network tool: Scapy, uses raw sockets to craft IP/TCP packets with automatic checksum calculations. Very robust and promising for packet manipulation. 
	\end{itemize} 
\\ \hline
File Size Division &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Express your available bandwidth as the average of your peers. Divide chunks up by $\frac{peer.bandwidth}{netBandwidth} \times{fileSize}$ and recursively subdivide.
		\item Sometimes the simplest approach is the most robust. Revised plan - divide the file into very thin chunks, that can be poped off and sending to each router as available in a fire and forget manner.
		\item Implement the dumb before thinking about client side request division algorithms.
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline
Writting and Logistics &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Google docs for LaTeX would be nice.
		\item Be sure to write about everything design related. Include a related works section in the full report.
		\item Craig explains Craig's grading schema. Brain-dump deliverable near the end of A term.
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline

For Next Week &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Work on http range splitting with the na\"{i}ve approach to prove this can work.
		\item download many small chunks and transmit over a persistent TCP connection between each router.
		\item Related works (bandwidth aggregation, golf cart wifi) writeup (3-5, but no more then 10 pages).
	\end{itemize}
