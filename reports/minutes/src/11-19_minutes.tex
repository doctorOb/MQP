Recap & 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Craig splurged on wireless antennas -> can do actual implementation on linux boxes (less worry about memory)
		\item Demo of current set up for next week on VMs. Demo will be able to cooperatively download content from a supplied URL given by a python client. Static HTML pages, while small, work best for visualizing success (or if chunks are missing).
	\end{itemize} 
\\ \hline

More on Trust &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Store transaction records (from each session with a peer) that summarizes the interaction. Average these with an included weight (older transactions matter less) to compute Trust factor for each peer. Inspired by this paper (\url{http://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/disl/PeerTrust/pub/xiong03reputation.pdf}
		\item Still unsure of how to compute Trust from an interaction. Look for the lowest level calculations in bit torrent and other similar interaction based systems.
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline

Peer Selection &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Trust, reliability, Performance.
		\item How do we keep track of reliability other then clients dropping?
		\item Use trust metric do decide how often we verify their data.
		\item Right now, we can only estimate bandwidth, or keep track of premature disconnects.
		\item What about TCP specifics? Not available through pythons TCP library, would have to re implement the socket library through raw sockets in order to get transport layer statistics (is it worth the time?)
		\item What level of abstraction is this project focused around? Right now Application layer.
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline

Verifying and a central key authority &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Will our end users want to go out of their way to acquire a certificate. Are free cert-authorities legitimate enough?
		\item Could we be the central authority. Set up a website for users to register under, generate and vouche for their certificates ourselves.
		\item We could encrypt and store logs from each router on our central server. 
		\item Establishing our own central authority can alleviate liability issues for the user.
		\item 
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline

Choosing where to go from here &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A lot of ``you could dos'' being thrown around. Choices need to be made and Dan needs to stick to one path.
		\item Present a time line at next meeting for scoping out the rest of the project, with justification and rationale for each decision.
		\item Pick priorities (trust, liability, connection recovery)
	\end{itemize}
