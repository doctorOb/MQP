Pycrypto and Repudiation & 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Set up message signing and signature verification between clients. 
		\item Inputs = target url. This is not enough to guarantee good repudiation.
	\end{itemize} 
\\ \hline
Breaking the Repudiation System &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hash(url + timestamp) and sign it. If a router tries to spoof the request after the original signature is signed, the verification will always fail.
		\item Temporality of access is extremely important. We want to keep the timestamp associated with each request in our logs.
		\item How do we combat private keys that ``go public'' (and are therefore compromised)?
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline

Emulating a notary &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two way handshake? Sign original request on receiver end and send back, which is resigned finally. ``A notary''
		\item Both keys would have to leak to violate non-repudiation.
		\item Handshake with a centralized server? - decentralized more simple in our case.
		\item Farm out to other peers. They verify the signature and add timestap, and sign it themselves, who returns it to the original worker.
		\item Have the entire network verify the request at once? What is the cost of a large scale notarization. Add to discussion.
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline

Next Week &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Checkpoint on writing and code deliverable
		\item Discussion on repudiation again
	\end{itemize}
