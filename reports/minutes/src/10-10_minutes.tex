Progress on the Paper & 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Consolidated scattered notes into their relevant sections of the report.
		\item Began adopting an NABC/Heilmeir's mentality for report writing. The report is a mixed bag of bullets, comments, and developed paragraphs.
	\end{itemize} 
\\ \hline
Evaluation Section &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What do we care about? Metrics such as performance (bandwidth), latency, liability, security. 
		\item How will it be scaled? How will we deal with timing out peers, and dynamically changing chunk size per peer. Who buffers out of order data?
		\item Conflict in the wireless spectrum will become a problem, as the peer to peer communication between potentially dozens of routers on a shared channel will be dense.
		\item Trade off who cashes their content, and ask them to send in sequence to avoid conflict
		\item Use Network Simulator (probably NS3) for most trials. Learn the tool over break.
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline
Discussion &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Haven't talked much about security. 2 Big issues, Integrity and Accountability
		\item How do we verify that our peers are sending the correct portion of the file? Zero Knowledge proof
		\item Download a small portion of bytes from the server yourself to check against the peers data.
		\item Non-reputiation and Accountability? Hash the original HTTP request with initiating router's private key, which can be checked with its public key which each neighbor knows about.Then we have a definitive method to prove who originally requested the file.
		\item Sign the HTTP request only, we can't afford to sign each individual chunk.
		\item Figure out what our Security Goals are and how we will guarantee them.
		\item Read some of Anderson's Security Engineering book (now free online).
