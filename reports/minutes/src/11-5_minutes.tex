Struggles with Python Bugs & 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Current approach might not work very well
		\item Client doesn't receive full response even though peers process it.
	\end{itemize} 
\\ \hline

Goals for the Term &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Network testing with NS3 to figure out how memory and CPU intensive it is.
		\item Consolidate the code base.
		\item Streamline inter-party communication (perfect and implement the protocol, perhaps using HTTP). Right now the router to router communication could be more organized.
		\item Build a trust model that peers can use when selecting neighbors for an aggregation session. Look to P2P for inspiration, as their protocol is built on trust (many ways to go about this, what's right for P2P might not be good for us).
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline

Trust Model &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Verification of data: buffer full response and check at the end.
		\item What happens when a peer sends back untruthful data? Dock their score or drop them completely.
		\item What if the web server lies to a peer? Breaks current verification model.
		\item Literature review of how P2P networks do this, and design the protocol in a manner similar to this. Cite'em!
		\item An hour in the library is worth a week in the lab.

	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline

Security &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Figure out what cryptographic protocols and libraries to use for signing each initial request (to tie responsibility to peers). Python libraries likely exist, find them.
		\item Encryption/MACing/Asymetric Signing primitives, find which to use.
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline

Misc &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Testing: Poke around with NS3, Routers and VMs.
		\item What does this protocol look like to the server? Will our range retrieval approach become a problem for servers that only allow one download per client. What if the server figures out the Dan protocol and poisons the zero knowledge proof answers.
		\item Write about everything. (3 pages per week as an arbitrary minimum)
	\end{itemize}
