Lesson on Paper writing & 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Krishna and Craig explained the right and wrong way to go about writing an academic paper of any decent size.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Wrong: Writing the introduction first
			\item Right: Iteratively updating each section with concise bullet points on a daily basis. Translate them to paper later on.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Apply literature design patterns: NABC and Heilmeier's Catechism
		\item Thinking about these principles throughout writing will help better structure the report.
		\item Bullet points are fine as long as they cover the subject area. Don't have to take a deep dive into formal writing.
	\end{itemize} 
\\ \hline
Python prototype so far &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Twisted proxy is here to stay.
		\item Infrastructure for taking requests and dispatching threads for each client is all set up (thanks to Twisted's robustness).
		\item Need to reevaluate design for managing and splitting up the packets.
		\item Having trouble managing data returned by peer client helpers.
		\item Look into map-reduce algorithm and multi-threading with python.
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline

Related Works Overview &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A lot of work has been done so far, dating back to the early 90s.
		\item Packet reordering and traffic distribution are the two key concerns with bandwidth aggregation. Each of the many realizations achieve this in their own way.
		\item Luckily, we're circumventing packet reordering
		\item New research focuses on Multipath TCP and combining multiple RATs (different antennas)
	\end{itemize}
\\ \hline
For Next Week &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Dive into threading with python to get a manager thread working.
		\item Consolidate report into one file, contribute daily to each section.
	\end{itemize}
